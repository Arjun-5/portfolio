      <p>Quantum Chess is a variation of the classical game of chess, where the pieces have quantum properties. 
It was created by Chris Cantwell and it is being developed by his team at the  <a href="https://quantumchess.net/">
Quantum Realm (Quantum Chess)</a>. It is interesting from a RL point of view because it has a continuous action 
and state space. Treating the game may require clever modification ranging from special architecture on 
the NN, to ML methods that involve quantum mechanics. It is interesting to mention that the game can 
run on a Quantum Computer.
