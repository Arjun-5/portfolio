          As a solo developer, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in the global VR/Game developers <a
            href="https://www.wearevr.berlin" target="_blank">hackathon</a> in Berlin, held from August 3<sup>rd</sup>
          to 19<sup>th</sup>. The focus of the challenge was to completely reimagine the design of a virtual helicopter
          cockpitâ€”not by simply replicating existing layouts, but by fully embracing the immersive possibilities of VR
          to create a truly intuitive and forward-thinking interface. This experience drove me to think beyond
          traditional control schemes and interaction methods, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in virtual
          reality design.

        <h1 class="headerStyle">Project Description</h1>
        <p class="textContent" style="text-align: justify;">The project was setup completely in Unreal Engine 5.0 and it
          was designated to run on
          Oculus Quest 2 VR device. The
          development spanned over a period of two weeks - I was mostly working on it after my work hours. The aim was
          to sort of
          bring a balance between the existing setup and pitch in some level of invovation. This way we make it easier
          for people
          to relate with the existing setup and possible updation that could make things a lot easier to comprehend.
          Here's a video
          recording that demonstrates the solution we pitched on this hackathon.

        <br>
        <p class="textContent" style="text-align: justify;">We ensured that there is a good amount of interaction
          involved in the application so that
          the
          participants will feel a great level of immersion thereby detatching themselves from the real world. Most of
          the
          controls can only be operated by physical movement of your hands which in turns drives the helicopter around
          in the
          scene. For example: To hold the flight control stick you move your hand next to stick and press a button on
          the Oculus
          quest 2 controller and then as you move your hand in the real world the control stick follows your hand
          position which
          drives the helicopter along the position of the stick/hand.

          The 3D environment, Tempelhof Field, choosen for the application is constructed in Arcgis CityEngine. This
          provided
          us an opportunity to place a real world environment with some realistic terrain and obstacles so the
          participants can
          get a better look and feel along with a significant level of immersiveness. We tried to use GIS plugins for
          game
          engines such as Cesium and ARCGis to load the 3D model on the fly but later dropped the plan since we couldn't
          find
          a free city model for Berlin that could be loaded into the application on the fly.
