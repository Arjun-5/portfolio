    Players consider the game to be very interesting and challenging, because it combines 
    random and cooperative aspects. The classic DouDiZhu game involves three players, 
    two of whom, called “the peasants”, need to cooperate against one another, called “the 
    landlord”. The peasants win if any of their hands are played first; otherwise, the landlord 
    wins. The profits or losses in the game are shared between the peasants while the 
    landlord carries himself alone, which means the game is a zero-sum game satisfying 
    the Nash Equilibrium. As in most card games, the starting hand of DouDiZhu can 
    primarily affect the outcome of the game. The rules of DouDiZhu are not complicated, 
    however, the two essential aspects of winning the game required strategies and skills. <br> <br>
    Since there are numerous card combinations at each time step, the number of possible 
    actions is huge. Because of this discrete action space and the complicated action 
    relationships, the game is a quite challenging reinforcement learning environment. 
    Moreover, compared to games like Chess and Go, DouDiZhu is an incomplete 
    information game that usually has more complicated solutions as well as an unique 
    game that emphasizes both competition and cooperation. <br><br>
    Our work is based on the environment from <a href="http://rlcard.org/">RLCard: A Toolkit for Reinforcement 
    Learning in Card Games></a>, you can find the original code of the RLCard framework here: <a href="https://github.com/datamllab/rlcard">https://github.com/datamllab/rlcard</a>. We have slightly modified the RLCard environment 
    for state encoding and state space. <br><br>
    In the beginning of our work we want to design several Doudizhu agents by applying 
    different deep reinforcement learning approaches like the popular <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02298">Rainbow DQN</a>
    architecture with different distributional components as well as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01121">Neural Fictitious SelfPlay</a> and others. Our first milestone is to beat the rule-based agents of the RLCard 
    Paper as landlord. We then will evaluate the impact of changes to the state encodings 
    of the original RLCard environment as well as different training settings. Once we 
    accomplish that we will pursue the most promising approaches and see how far we can 
    push them.</p>
