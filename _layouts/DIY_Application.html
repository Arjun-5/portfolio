        <span class="textContent">I made significant contributions to a DIY VR project, focusing exclusively on the
          Inspector section, which
          provides users with a detailed, intuitive interface for interacting with selected objects. This system offers
          a comprehensive overview
          of every aspect of the selected object, including its properties and components, giving users the ability to
          easily modify and manage
          the objects attributes. By ensuring the interface was user-friendly and visually clear, I helped create a more
          seamless and efficient
          workflow for end users. The inspector also supports advanced functionalities such as drag-and-drop operations,
          multi-object selection,
          and real-time updates, making it a versatile tool for managing objects within the VR environment.</span>

        <span class="textContent">The project was setup completely in Unity Engine and it was designated to run on
          Oculus
          Quest VR device. The project was
          managed by two members (including me) and my task was to create a custom inpsector setup that can used in
          runtime, mimicing the Unity
          Inspector. In the DIY VR project, the inspector section plays a critical role in providing a clear,
          intuitive interface for interacting with objects in the virtual environment. It is designed to give users
          direct control
          over the selected object by displaying all relevant properties and components in a well-organized manner.

        <li class="textContent">
          <span style="font-family: 'Cooper Black'; color: #F2AA4C;">Transform Section :</span> This section prominently
          shows the core properties of the object, such
          as its name, position,
          rotation, and scale values. Users can directly edit these properties to adjust how the object appears and
          behaves in the scene.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class="textContent">
          <span style="font-family: 'Cooper Black'; color: #F2AA4C;"> Component List Section: </span> Below the
          transform section is a list of all components attached to the object.
          Each component is represented by a button with an icon, making it easy to identify at a glance.
          These components can include built-in components like rigidbodies or colliders,
          as well as custom scripts or user-defined components.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class="textContent">
          <span style="font-family: 'Cooper Black'; color: #F2AA4C;"> Component Details: </span> When a user clicks on a
          component button, detailed information about that component is
          displayed.
          This information is broken down into fields and references. Fields can include any editable property within
          the component,
          while references point to other objects or components in the scene. The system uses reflection to
          automatically extract and
          display all the fields in a clean, readable format.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class="textContent">
          <span style="font-family: 'Cooper Black'; color: #F2AA4C;"> Reference Selection Panel: </span> If a component
          contains references (e.g., to a collider or another object),
          clicking a reference button opens a small panel displaying all relevant game objects that can be assigned to
          this reference.
          For instance, if the reference is a collider, the panel will list all game objects that have collider
          components.
          Users can then either select an object from the list or use a drag-and-drop feature to assign it.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class="textContent">
          <span style="font-family: 'Cooper Black'; color: #F2AA4C;"> Drag-and-Drop Support: </span> The inspector
          allows users to drag objects from the scene directly into the reference
          fields in the
          inspector, making it simple to assign components and objects without needing to type in or search for names
          manually.

        <br>
        <li class="textContent">
          <span style="font-family: 'Cooper Black'; color: #F2AA4C;"> Lock Button: </span> A lock button is provided to
          keep the current object’s inspector view fixed, allowing users to
          interact with
          other parts of the scene without losing the view of the currently selected object’s details. This is
          especially useful when
          adjusting multiple objects or comparing settings across objects.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class="textContent">
          <span style="font-family: 'Cooper Black'; color: #F2AA4C;"> Default Component Selection: </span> Upon
          selecting an object, the first component in the list is automatically
          selected, and its
          details are loaded into the inspector. This saves the user time by immediately providing access to component
          information
          without extra clicks.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class="textContent">
          <span style="font-family: 'Cooper Black'; color: #F2AA4C;"> Multiple Object Selection: </span> When multiple
          objects are selected in the scene, the inspector intelligently
          updates to show only
          the components that are shared across all the selected objects. This allows for bulk-editing shared
          properties without
          losing track of individual object specifics.
        </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <span class="textContent">The entire inspector system is designed to enhance usability and efficiency in VR
          development, ensuring that users
          have a powerful, flexible tool to manage object properties, components, and references seamlessly. The
          combination of reflection-based
          field extraction, dynamic reference selection, and a user-friendly interface makes this inspector a vital part
          of the VR development
          workflow.
