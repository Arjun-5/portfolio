              <p>We are a team of Bachelor and Master students doing our Theses under the supervision of Dr. Vaios Laschos. All our projects combine Reinforcement learning and Meta-learning techniques, and our testbeds are always board and video games, which makes the whole procedure very entertaining and addicting. If you are interested in joining our team, please communicate with  <a href="http://vaiosphere.com/">Vaios Laschos.</a> </p>
