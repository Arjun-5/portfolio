        <span class="textContent">The idea behind creating the Admin Dashboard was to provide administrators with a
          centralized, intuitive interface that simplifies the management and oversight of complex VR environments. As
          VR training systems grow in sophistication, there was a clear need for a tool that offers real-time visibility
          into user interactions and system performance, while also allowing for adaptive control based on physiological
          feedback. The dashboard was conceived to streamline this process, empowering administrators to monitor stress
          levels, trigger events, and analyze data with ease, all while ensuring the VR experience remains dynamic,
          personalized, and effective for every user.

          <span style="font-family: 'Cooper Black'; color: #cfc9c2;">Real-Time Data Visualization üåê : </span> The admin
          panel features a highly responsive dashboard powered by LiveCharts, allowing administrators to visualize user
          actions, system responses, and stress events in real time. The dashboard dynamically updates based on incoming
          data, offering a clear, graphical representation of the ongoing events in the VR environment. It leverages the
          powerful capabilities of WPF to deliver fluid animations and responsive charting, making it easier for
          administrators to track key performance metrics and stress indicators.

          <span style="font-family: 'Cooper Black'; color: #cfc9c2;">Event Triggering Based on User State üéØ : </span>
          By processing physiological data such as heart rate and motion patterns, the AI system adjusts the VR
          environment to match the user's emotional state. When users experience stress or calmness, the AI reacts in
          real-time, either intensifying or soothing the simulation. The admin panel manages this adaptive behavior,
          giving administrators the ability to override or customize event triggers. Developed using C# and XAMLs
          robust data binding, it allows seamless integration between the AI logic and the user interface.

          <span style="font-family: 'Cooper Black'; color: #cfc9c2;"> Event Logging and Analysis üìä : </span>
          Every interaction within the VR system is logged and stored for post-session analysis. This data is essential
          for improving future sessions and understanding how users respond to various stress events. The logging
          feature includes detailed timestamps, event descriptions, and user data. By utilizing WPFs templating and
          rich UI elements, the admin panel provides a structured and filterable log viewer that can be analyzed through
          various time intervals or event types. This ensures administrators have a granular view of user behavior and
          system performance.

          manage user sessions directly from the panel, including monitoring user connectivity and communication with
          the VR environment. The user management system is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for real-time
          updates, session control, and status monitoring. Built using C# for backend logic and XAML for front-end user
          experience, it simplifies managing users across multiple sessions while maintaining a clean and efficient
          interface.

          <span style="font-family: 'Cooper Black'; color: #cfc9c2;"> Timer-Based Stress Events ‚è±Ô∏è : </span>
          Beyond AI-driven events, the admin panel also incorporates a timer-based event system. This feature triggers
          pre-programmed stress scenarios at specified intervals, ensuring that users experience consistent simulation
          challenges. The timer system is implemented using C# timers, and administrators can customize these intervals
          through the panels interface. This feature guarantees that even in non-AI sessions, users undergo a
          controlled and repeatable stress-testing process.

        <span style="font-family: 'Cooper Black'; color: #cfc9c2;"> Why is the Admin Panel important? üåü </span>
        <span class="textContent">The Admin Panel is a critical component of VR training environments, providing
          administrators with real-time insight into both user behavior and system performance. By combining AI-driven
          event management with detailed data analysis, it ensures that the VR environment adapts dynamically to each
          user's needs. The use of XAML and WPF in the panel‚Äôs development allows for a rich, modern user interface,
          while C# ensures smooth backend processing. Integrating tools like LiveCharts elevates the visualization of
          real-time data, offering clarity and precision in monitoring.
          <br> <br>
          This panel is indispensable for administrators aiming to optimize user experiences, adjust stress levels based
          on physiological data, and improve safety training outcomes through detailed post-session analysis.
