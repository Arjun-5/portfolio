      <p>Hanabi is a very fun game to play, and it is currently our main project. The game contains many 
complexities like Radomness, partial observability, big observation space, etc. However, the biggest 
challenge with the game is the existence of a non-verbal way to communicate information. This 
information, that is called intention by some, is communicated through the choice of action and 
specifically through a hint system. </p>
